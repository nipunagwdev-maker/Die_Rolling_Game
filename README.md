# Die_Rolling_Game
This is my first Python program from Mosh. Itâ€™s a simple Dice Rolling Game.

When you enter 'Y' or 'y', the program generates two random numbers (like rolling two dice) and prints the results.

If you enter 'N' or 'n', the program stops and displays "Thanks for playing".

If you enter any other characters, the program shows "Invalid input".
